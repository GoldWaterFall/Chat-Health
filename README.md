# Chat-Health
This project "Chat Health" aims at creating a platform for the Chinese market dedicated to facilitating online consultation and registration for patients. We want to solve this core problem:

By looking for a suitable solution to ensure the fairness of patients' medical treatment, through the comparison and selection of a large number of identification and authentication methods, the most suitable solution is finalized to ensure that patients can register themselves and crack down on scalpers reselling registration orders.

This website serves as the code repository of our project during the whole development process. All codes of this project will be uploaded to this webiste continuously to ensure the credibility and transparency of our project programming process, and we will provide instruction for visiters about how to run and use these codes on their own computer.
